**Movie Recommendation System**:
A machine learning-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on genres, keywords, cast, and director. It utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity for content-based filtering.
Project Overview:
-Analyzing movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, director)
-Computing similarity scores using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity
-Providing personalized recommendations
-Exposing an API for easy integration
----------------------------------
Key Features:
-Content-based filtering using machine learning
-Real-time recommendations based on user input
-Customizable dataset – works with any movies.csv
-Scalable and lightweight solution
---------------------------------------
Methodology:
**1** Data Preprocessing
 Loaded movies.csv dataset
 Handled missing values in genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director
 Created combined text features for vectorization
**2** Feature Extraction
 Applied TF-IDF Vectorization to extract text-based features
 Converted text into numerical feature vectors
**3** Similarity Calculation
 Used Cosine Similarity to compute distances between movies
 Retrieved top-N similar movies for a given title
**4** API Deployment
 Built a Flask API for real-time recommendations
 Allowed dynamic movie search via API
-------------------------------
Technologies Used:
Python - Core programming language
Pandas - Data manipulation
NumPy - Numerical operations
Scikit-Learn - Machine learning & similarity calculation
Flask - API development
Jupyter Notebook - Model testing
--------------------------------------------
